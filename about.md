# About

Hi there!

I am a final year Electrical and Biomedical Engineering student at The University of Queensland! As part of the course **ELEC4630 - Image Processing and Computer Vision**, I have been introduced into the exciting realm of deep learning/Fast.ai. 

As a newcomer to this fascinating field, I'm still in the early stages of my deep learning journey. I'm constantly learning and exploring the incredible possibilities that deep learning and Fast.ai offer, and I am particularly interested to see how it can be used in the realm of biomedical engineering.
Through this blog, I'll be sharing my experiences, discoveries, and challenges as I navigate the intricacies of Fast.ai. It will be a personal account of my growth and learning process, which I aim to keep active post course completition.
