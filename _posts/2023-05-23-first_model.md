## My first Fast.ai Model

This morning, I trained a model in fast.ai that does a surprisingly decent job of differentiating between 10 different animals. 

[Here’s my animal classifier notebook!](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f7c881ImRZC4xVS6VUMfh-2akrpRVFPq#scrollTo=QRzAlHhYSedH)

Through a series of iterative experiments, I carefully adjusted the search parameters to generate specific search strings. 
so that I could fine-tune my model with a reasonable error rate. The table shows the results of my `vision_learner()` which uses `resnet18`.

I still feel a little uncomfortable to run so much code that I don’t fully understand yet (as I am still in the early stages of the fast.ai course), 
but I am taking Jeremy’s advice and went ahead with building my animal classifier model. I'm sure as I get further ahead in the course, the code will begin to make sense. What I know so far though is that fast.ai is very neat code and very powerful.
